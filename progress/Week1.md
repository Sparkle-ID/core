# SparkleID Development Roadmap - Week 1

## Week 1: Core Infrastructure and DID Management

### Objective
Set up the foundational architecture for SparkleID, including integration with the Hedera network and implementation of basic Decentralized Identifier (DID) creation and management.

---

### Tasks

#### 1. **Hedera Environment Setup**
- Configure a development environment for the Hedera testnet.
- Create test accounts on the Hedera testnet for transactions.

#### 2. **DID Creation and Management**
- Implement basic DID generation for patients and healthcare providers.
- Store DID metadata (e.g., associated public keys, roles).

#### 3. **Hedera File Service (HFS) Integration**
- Set up HFS for decentralized file storage.
- Create a script to upload, retrieve, and delete files on HFS.

#### 4. **Smart Contract Development**
- Develop initial smart contracts for managing DID-related permissions and access control.
- Deploy and test smart contracts on the Hedera testnet.

#### 5. **Basic Logging and Monitoring**
- Implement logging for DID creation and HFS interactions.
- Set up monitoring for successful and failed transactions.

### Deliverables
1. Hedera testnet development environment.
2. Basic DID creation and metadata storage functionality.
3. HFS integration with basic file upload and retrieval capabilities.
4. Initial smart contracts for access control.
5. Logging and monitoring scripts for core functionalities.

### GitHub Issues
Use the following checklist to track progress:

- [ ] Set up Hedera testnet environment.
- [ ] Implement DID creation and metadata storage.
- [ ] Integrate HFS for file storage operations.
- [ ] Develop and deploy basic access control smart contracts.
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms.

---

### Notes
- Refer to the [Hedera SDK Documentation](https://hedera.com/docs) for setting up the development environment and integrating the Hedera network.
- Use placeholder data for testing DID creation and HFS storage in this phase.

### Progress Updates
Ensure all tasks are tracked via GitHub Issues for better collaboration and transparency.
